# Expense Formatter

This is a helper tool that pairs with the FIRE ["One Spreadsheet to Rule them All"](https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/share-your-badassity/one-sheet-to-rule-them-all/)

In the spreadsheet, there's a tab that references transactions to aggregate them. This script helps automatically parse the Personal Capital transactions and formats them so that you can use them in the spreadsheet to calculate monthly expenses.
